This is my first post!  I am finally spending the time to get a website up so I can finally show you all what I'm
working on.  

#### VoiceBox
Currently, I am trying to get the word about VoiceBox.  VoiceBox is an Android App that helps voice actors keep track
of their voices for their projects.  It could also be helpful for dungeon masters, and parents who read to their kids.  It would be especially helpful for audiobook readers for books with lots of side characters.
